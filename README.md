 V :P and more

working:
- call
- gps
- audio
- All data connections (wifi and cellular)
- Most off the video's
- Houdini 6.1.1a_*
- Vibrator

Not working:
- SElinux
- Many more things

What needs to be done:
- Enable fully working SElinux
- Enable camera (api/missing functions)
- Enable A-GPS
- Fix WVM codecs
- Fix network search and switch (2g/3g)
- Possibly many more

Also debug features are on. Device is a little slow with all those warnings, errors etc.
